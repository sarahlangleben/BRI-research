Vision and Actions on Energy Cooperation in Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road
, 
	When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Central and Southeast Asia in the second half of 2013, he raised the initiative of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (hereinafter referred to as the Belt and Road Initiative). In March 2015, the Chinese government published the Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road white paper, which stated that the Belt and Road Initiative is open and inclusive. China welcomes all countries and international or regional organizations to join the initiative, which is internationally recognized and has received positive responses.
, 
	Energy is indispensable for progress in mankind's development, and is closely related to peoples livelihoods in all countries. Strengthening energy cooperation in jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative will stimulate wider and deeper regional cooperation at a higher level for the economic prosperity of the whole worlda goal which China and other countries around the world strive for. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) of China have jointly drafted and published this white paper to promote the implementation of the Initiative, instill vigor and vitality into the ancient Silk Road, and promote mutually beneficial collaboration to new highs.

. Global Energy Development
, 
	Complex and profound changes in terms of the global energy market are taking place. The supply and demand balance in the market is generally easing; response to climate change is moving into a new stage; a new round of revolution in energy technology accelerates; a new mechanism for global energy governance is developing; but the goal of sustainable energy for all is nonetheless far from reach and all countries face big challenges in their energy development.
, 
	The Belt and Road Initiative seeks to foster energy cooperation in order to jointly build up an open, inclusive, and beneficial community of shared interests, responsibility and destiny. The Initiative also aims to improve regional energy safety and to optimize the distribution of energy resources. It will integrate regional energy markets and push forward the green and low-carbon development of regional energy. By doing so, the scheme will meet increasing demand for energy and advance economic development in countries involved in the Initiative.
, 
	At the age of globalization, China is closely connected with the rest of the world, and so is its energy sector. China will continue to promote international cooperation on energy and integrate itself even deeper to the world energy system. The Initiative not only underpins Chinas energy development but also coordinates such development in other countries in the world. China is committed to shouldering more responsibilities and obligations within its capacity, and seeks to make greater contributions to the development of mankind's energy sources.
