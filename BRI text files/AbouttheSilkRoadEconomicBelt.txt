The Silk Road Economic Belt is a long-term vision for the infrastructural development, connectivity and economic cooperation of Eurasia. It is considered the longest economic corridor in the world -- and potentially the most dynamic -- connecting the Asia-Pacific region in the East with developed European economies in the West., The six major economic corridors usually refer to the New Eurasian Land Bridge, the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC), the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the China-Central and Western Asia Economic Corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIMEC)., Departments and organizations  under the State Council, Local Governments, Subsites of Belt and Road Portal, Partners, Media, International Organizations
